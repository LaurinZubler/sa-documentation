  "The Challenges of Sailing",
  [
    Sailing is a skillful blend of art and science, particularly evident in the understanding and utilization of wind and the selection of sailable courses. This section briefly explores these core challenges, setting the stage for the potential enhancements that Augmented Reality can offer in this domain.

  "Wind",
  [
    One of the most significant challenges in sailing is the mastery of wind. Sailors must read and interpret wind patterns, which are often unpredictable and change rapidly. Understanding wind direction, strength, and shifts is crucial, as these factors directly influence the boat's speed and maneuverability.

  "Course",
  [
    Navigating a sailboat also involves the strategic selection of sailable courses. This requires not just an understanding of the wind but also the ability to plot a course that maximizes efficiency and safety. Sailors must constantly make decisions about the best angles to sail relative to the wind, considering factors like current, tide, and potential hazards.

    @sailable_courses illustrates the 'no-sail zones' for a sailboat, depicted in gray. These zones represent the angles at which a sailboat cannot sail directly into the wind, typically around 40° to 45° on either side of the wind direction. Additionally, the diagram highlights the downwind area where sailing is also challenging. The exact angles of these no-sail zones can vary depending on the type and design of the boat, reflecting differences in sailing capabilities and characteristics.
