    Augmented Reality (AR) is a technology that combines the real world with computer generated information. It enhances a user's perception by overlaying digital content onto the real world view. The content can involve text or 3D graphics. \
    Milgram et al. @Milgram.1995 have introduced the concept of a mixed reality. As seen on @rv_continuum they defined a reality-virtuality continuum representing a spectrum of experiences ranging from the entirely real world to the entirely virtual world. On this spectrum AR is more on the side of real environment.

    Augmented Reality can be displayed on various devices. \
    Optical see-through AR displays project the digital content into the user's field of vision. If the device is worn on the head, it is referred to as a head-mounted display (HMD). Informally, HMD's are often referrd as smartglasses. An example of a HMD is the Microsoft HoloLens, seen on TODO Foti.\
    Video see-through AR displays use a camera to capture the real world and insert the digital content into the video. 
    A example of this is the game Pok√©mon Go, which projected the games content into the surroundings using the smartphones camera, seen on Todo Foto.
