  [Introduction],
  [
    Augmented Reality (AR) is a technology that combines the real world with computer generated information. It enhances a user's perception by overlaying digital content onto the real world view. The content can involve text or 3D graphics. \
    Milgram et al. @Milgram.1995 have introduced the concept of a mixed reality. As seen on _ @rv_continuum _ they defined a reality-virtuality continuum representing a spectrum of experiences ranging from the entirely real world to the entirely virtual world. On this spectrum AR is more on the side of real environment.

    Augmented Reality is utilized across various domains.
    - *Guidance*: In manual assembly, AR aids operators by providing instructions. _ @ar_applications (a)_ demonstrates how the physical reality is enhanced with information on task completion, without occupying the operators hands. Enabling operators to focus on manual tasks and optimizing cognitive resources. #footnote[https://www.press.bmwgroup.com/global/photo/detail/P90343106/Training-new-staff-is-supported-by-augmented-reality-glasses-and-virtual-assistance-at-the-assembly]

    - *Expand reality*: AR is employed to visualize non existent objects or concepts._ @ar_applications (b)_ illustrates how applications can virtually showcase furniture in a user's living space. This empowers individuals to envision how diverse pieces of furniture might appear in their rooms and interact seamlessly with their current environment. Users can experiment with different colors, styles, and arrangements, enhancing their ability to make informed decisions. #footnote[https://www.ikea.com/de/de/this-is-ikea/corporate-blog/ikea-place-app-augmented-reality-puba55c67c0]

    - *Visualize the unseen*: AR unveils objects that would remain invisible under normal circumstances. Comparable to X-ray technology, this allows for a peek into objects._ @ar_applications (c)_ demonstrates how underground infrastructure is made visible. Such as water pipes, gas lines, or electrical conduits. #footnote[https://www.xyht.com/constructionbim/visualizing-hidden-infrastructure-in-3d/]

    - *Visualize data*: AR transforms abstract numbers into tangible reality. In _ @ar_applications (d)_ computer network traffic is visualized, providing a dynamic and interactive representation. This enables users to gain a real-time understanding of complex data patterns, enhancing their ability to monitor and respond to changes efficiently. #footnote[https://imld.de/en/research/research-projects/ar-graph-vis/]

  [Hardware],
  [
    Augmented Reality can be displayed on various devices. \
    _Optical see-through AR displays_ project the digital content into the user's field of vision. If the device is worn on the head, it is referred to as a head-mounted display (HMD). Informally, HMD's are often called smartglasses. An example of a HMD is the Microsoft HoloLens, seen on TODO Foti.\
    Displays mounted in front of the user, are Head-on Displays. They found use in fight jets or are integrated in the windshield slide of cars. TODO Foti \
    _Video see-through AR displays_ use a camera to capture the real world and insert the digital content into the video. 
    A example of this is the game Pok√©mon Go, which projected the games content into the surroundings using the smartphones camera, seen on TODO Foto.
