  [Definition],
  [
    Augmented Reality (AR) is a technology that combines the real world with computer-generated information. It enhances a user's perception by overlaying digital content, like 3D graphics or text, onto the real-world view. \
    Milgram et al. @Milgram.1995 have introduced the concept of a mixed reality. As seen on @rv_continuum they defined a reality-virtuality continuum representing a spectrum of experiences ranging from the entirely real world to the entirely virtual world. On this spectrum AR is more on the side of real environment.
