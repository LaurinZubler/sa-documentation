== Augmented Reality
#global.paragraph(
  [Introduction],
  [
    Augmented Reality (AR) is a technology that combines the real world with computer generated information. It enhances a user's perception by overlaying digital content onto the real world view. The content can involve text or 3D graphics. \
    Milgram et al. @Milgram.1995 have introduced the concept of a mixed reality. As seen on _ @rv_continuum _ they defined a reality-virtuality continuum representing a spectrum of experiences ranging from the entirely real world to the entirely virtual world. On this spectrum AR is more on the side of real environment.

  [Applications],
  [
    Augmented Reality is utilized across various domains.
    - *Guidance*: In manual assembly, AR aids operators by providing instructions. _ @ar_applications (a)_ demonstrates how the physical reality is enhanced with information on task completion, without occupying the operators hands. Enabling the operator to focus on the manual task and optimizing cognitive resources. #footnote[https://www.press.bmwgroup.com/global/photo/detail/P90343106/Training-new-staff-is-supported-by-augmented-reality-glasses-and-virtual-assistance-at-the-assembly]

    - *Expand reality*: AR is employed to visualize non existent objects or concepts._ @ar_applications (b)_ illustrates how applications can virtually showcase furniture in a user's living space. This empowers individuals to envision how diverse pieces of furniture might appear in their rooms and interact seamlessly with their current environment. Users can experiment with different colors, styles, and arrangements, enhancing their ability to make informed decisions. #footnote[https://www.ikea.com/de/de/this-is-ikea/corporate-blog/ikea-place-app-augmented-reality-puba55c67c0]

    - *Visualize the unseen*: AR unveils objects that would remain invisible under normal circumstances. Comparable to X-ray technology, this allows for a peek into objects._ @ar_applications (c)_ demonstrates how underground infrastructure is made visible. Such as water pipes, gas lines, or electrical conduits. #footnote[https://www.xyht.com/constructionbim/visualizing-hidden-infrastructure-in-3d/]

    - *Visualize data*: AR transforms abstract numbers into tangible reality. In _ @ar_applications (d)_ computer network traffic is visualized, providing a dynamic and interactive representation. This enables users to gain a real-time understanding of complex data patterns, enhancing their ability to monitor and respond to changes efficiently. #footnote[https://imld.de/en/research/research-projects/ar-graph-vis/]

  [Hardware],
  [
    Augmented Reality is showcased on various devices.
    
    - *Optical see-through AR displays* display the digital content directly on a transparent glass into the user's field of vision. The physical reality is still visible though the glass.
      - _Head-mounted displays (HMD)_ are worn on the head. Infomally often referred to as smartglasses. An example of an HMD is the Microsoft HoloLens, shown in _ @ar_hardware (a)_. #footnote[https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/industry/blog/manufacturing-and-mobility/2019/06/17/workforce-transformation-in-the-intelligent-manufacturing-era/]
      - _Head-up displays (HUD)_ are mounted in front of the user. For example integrated in a cars windshield, as illustrated in _ @ar_hardware (b)_.

    - *Video see-through AR displays* utilize a camera to capture the real world and insert digital content into the video. The camera and display can either be integrated into the same device, as seen on _ @ar_applications (b)_ with the smartphone app. Or camera and display are separate components. #footnote[https://www.gizmochina.com/2021/11/29/volvo-new-tech-car-windshields-ar-display/]

== Augmented Reality in Sailing
#global.paragraph(
  [Introduction],
  [
    Understanding the relationship between wind, boat, and course is fundamental for sailing. The wind acts as the primary force shaping the direction in which the boat can navigate. The dynamic interplay of wind and chosen course dictates the optimal sail position.

    The wind is not a constant force. It changes in direction and intensity. Consequently, continual adjustments to the course and sails are required.
   
    However, the wind itself can not be seen. Its direction can only be recognized through observation. Either on tactile sensations, such as the feel on the skin, or by observing responsive elements like flags or waves that react to the wind's influence.

    Further
    - navigation: h√§fen, untiefen, bojen
    - collision: other boats

  [Application of AR],
  [
    The integration of Augmented Reality into sailing holds the potential to address a spectrum of challenges. The capability for data visualization can be utilized to better understand the surrounding environment. For example the wind or relevant information for navigation. Augmented Reality demonstrates expertise in making the invisible visible, such as underwater obstacles or changes in depth. 
    It can be used to visually guide and provide precise instructions on sail positioning and maneuvers.

    There is already research concerning AR and sailing that will be reviewed in the following.
