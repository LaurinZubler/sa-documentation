    After four training sessions in the beginner course, Laura has grasped the principles behind basic maneuvers like tacking and jibing. The practical application, particularly handling and steering with the tiller, remains a persistent challenge for her. She has not yet fully understood the connection between wind direction and the navigable course of the sailboat.
    Additionally, she faces challenges in low wind, struggling to discern its direction. Strong winds pose a greater challenge, often resulting in capsizing. Understanding the optimal sail position remains a puzzle for her.
