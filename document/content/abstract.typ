  [Introduction],
  [
    Sailing is a complex activity and navigating a boat successfully, a deep understanding of the surrounding environment is required. Traditional sailing instrument interfaces are displaying the ambient information in numerical form or as 2D graphs. Requiring some experience and spatial imagination to interpret them correctly. \
    Augmented Reality is an emerging technology with the capability to overlay the real world view with digital content. This thesis is exploring the potential of Augmented Reality to enhance the visualization of ambient conditions while sailing.

  [Method],
  [
    The method involved a literature research to understand the current scientific state in this domain. Additionally, five interviews were conducted with a mix of experienced and inexperienced sailors to identify the specific needs and preferences encountered while sailing.

  [Results],
  [
    Based on the conclusions of the literature research and the interviews, possible personas and scenarios of Augmented Reality applications were elaborated.
    The personas encapsulate the diverse user needs and preferences, while the scenarios offer context specific insights. 
    For one scenario a hardware component architecture was prepared for a future implementation.

  [Recommen-\ dations], 
  [
    The findings suggest promising potential for integrating Augmented Reality into sailing, offering an improved understanding of ambient conditions. 
    While technically feasible, current Augmented Reality headsets do not fulfill the requirements for a maritime environment, particularly in terms of waterproofing. Therefore, despite the promising concept, it is advisable to await further advancements in AR technology before widespread implementation in the sailing community.
