  "Scientific Working",
  [
    For the first time in my academic journey, this thesis presented me with the opportunity to deeply dive into a topic. It was exciting to immerse myself in the world of science, discovering new perspectives and methodologies that were previously unfamiliar to me. Initially, this felt like an impenetrable jungle, quite overwhelming in its complexity. Delving into the topic and striving to understand all its facets was a challenging yet rewarding experience. This involved learning how to navigate various academic databases and discerning which sources were most credible and pertinent. Gradually, as I familiarized myself with the research material, what once seemed like an overwhelming abundance of information began to take on a clearer structure, making the journey into the topic not only manageable but deeply enriching.

  "First Times",
  [
    In this thesis, I encountered numerous _first times_, instances where I had to venture into uncharted territory and figure out the best approach to do something.
    This involved aspects of project management, choosing the right tools, structuring and formatting the documentation, among various other tasks.
    While these activities initially took time and occasionally seemed to slow my progress, they have prepared me for future project. As I approach my bachelor's thesis in the next semester, I feel well-equipped and confident, having built a strong foundation of skills and knowledge.

  "Writing",
  [
    Writing has always been difficult for me. A hurdle that is significantly different from the logical structure of software coding that I am used to. The art of writing offers endless permutations of words and sentence structures, without the binary certainty of code. This possibilities often left my programmer's mind wrestling with choices and styles, striving to find the "optimal syntax" in a world where it scarcely exists. Often, it felt like I had to suck the words out of my fingers, a slow and painstaking process.

    The support and guidance of my advisor have been helping me tackle this challenge. His positive feedback on the sections I wrote not only motivated me but also reassured me that I am apparently doing quite well. 
    I also had to come to the conclusion that, I just needed to worry less about the perfect wording.

  "Work Live Balance",
  [
    Throughout the course of this thesis, maintaining a healthy work-life balance proved to be a significant challenge. This struggle was further intensified by major life events, including moving to a new place and embarking on a new job. These changes occasionally heightened the pressure, adding complexity to the task of managing my time effectively.

    As I approach my bachelor thesis in the next semester, I am actively working towards establishing a more sustainable balance between my studies, work, and personal life. Finding this equilibrium is crucial for my overall well-being, ensuring that I can manage all my responsibilities effectively while also taking care of my personal needs.
