== Discussion on Results
#global.paragraph(
  "Achievements",
  [
    This thesis has accomplished several advances in the application of Augmented Reality applications in sailing. 
    
    The literature research established the validity and potential of Augmented Reality in enhancing the sailing experience.

    Five interviews with a diverse group of sailors analyzed the challenges and needs of the sailing community. They provided insights into the practical aspects of sailing and formed a solid foundation for the development of three personas.

    Seven scenarios were developed, four of which are entirely new innovations. These scenarios represent a diverse range of applications, each designed to address specific challenges identified in the research and the interviews.

    The most promising scenario was selected and a detailed architecture for the hardware components was created. Laying the foundation for future implementation of this Augmented Reality application.

  "Design and Implementation",
  [
    Contrary to the original assumptions made in the project brief, the thesis did not progress to the design and implementation of a prototype. The focus shifted towards research, as more studies were discovered than initially anticipated. The evaluation of the research material was deemed more valuable at this stage of the thesis.

    Additionally, the nature of working individually on this project imposed certain limitations. The amount of work that could be realistically achieved alone would not have been enough to build a satisfactory prototype. This also contributed to the decision to focus on the research.

    As a result, this thesis forms a theoretical basis for the development of Augmented Reality applications in sailing. It lays the groundwork for future projects, where the insights gathered can be implemented into functional solutions.

== Recommendations
#global.paragraph(
  "AR Technology",
  [
    This thesis has found several considerations regarding the current state of Augmented Reality technology being used in maritime environments. The primary challenges identified are the durability and waterproofing capabilities.

    It is recommended to closely monitor ongoing advancements in Augmented Reality technology. The field is evolving, and future developments could address the maritime-specific challenges more effectively.

    In the meantime, exploring interim solutions or adaptations that can bridge the gap is advisable. This could involve developing protective casings and modifications to enhance durability. Such interim solutions would not only provide immediate benefits to the sailing community but also offer valuable insights and experiences that can inform the development of future, more advanced Augmented Reality systems suited for maritime conditions.

  [HoloLens \ Field Test],
  [
    In addition to the fact that the HoloLens is not suitable for maritime environments, there are other questions about its usability that warrant exploration.
    It is recommended to conduct a field test to evaluate the following aspects:

    - *Functionality of the Moving Platform Mode on a Sailboat* This aims to determine whether the HoloLens can effectively track the environment on a moving sailboat and accurately display holograms. 

    - *Alignment with the Boat's Axis* This test aims to determine if the HoloLens can align itself with the boat's axis using its onboard cameras or if additional external sensors are necessary for precise positioning. 

    - *Outdoor Performance in Sunlight* This test aims to determine if the HoloLens is usable in outdoor sunlight conditions. It consists of two parts: firstly, assessing whether the holograms remain visible in bright light conditions, and secondly, evaluating if the cameras can effectively capture information under such lighting conditions.

    Due to the HoloLens's limitations in maritime settings and restricted access to a sailboat during winter conditions, the field test could not be carried out within the timeframe of this thesis. Therefore, these aspects remain to be tested under appropriate environmental conditions in future development phases."

  [Next Steps _Sailing Course Assistant_],
  [
    As next step in the further development of the _Sailing Course Assistant_, it is suggested to create a design prototype.
    Employing a human-centered approach is highly recommended to ensure the prototype  addresses the needs of the sailing community and an optimal user experience is achieved.
    This involves actively engaging with sailors to gather their insights and feedback.
